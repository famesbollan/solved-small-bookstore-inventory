You have been hired by a bookstore to provide them a system that can maintain the costs of up to 3 different book titles; it’s a small bookstore. The owners would like to be able to do the following:

<ul>

 <li>        1.    Enter the names of 3 books.</li>

</ul>

2.    Enter the cost of each book being maintained.

<ol start="3">

 <li>Enter the quantity of each book</li>

 <li>Calculate the total value of each book title</li>

</ol>

5.    Provide the total costs of inventory (total of all the books in inventory – see formula)

<ol start="6">

 <li>Provide the average cost of inventory of all books</li>

</ol>

Total Value of each book = Cost * Quantity

Total Inventory = (Sum of (Cost * Quantity) of each book)

(i.e. multiply the cost of each book by the quantity entered and add all these to obtain the total cost of inventory)

Average Cost of Inventory = Total Inventory  Total Quantity of Books

<strong>Assume the following:   3 names and costs were entered.</strong>

The input/output for each of the respective requirements should be similar to (assumes all 3 books were entered):

The list of inventory is:

Book Title                             Cost        Quantity                Inventory Value

1.    Fury                               $ 24.12         2                       $ 48.24

2.    Little Women               $ 5.00          3                        $ 15.00
